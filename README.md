##Demo Database

The system comes with a sample database (data/database.db) that includes:

Employee records

Attendance data

Payroll history

You can use this to try out the system without importing files.

##If you want to import data

1.) For employee Details: You can import the database from the website https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189fvPCZS7JKMBYos00ZEoApqnBB05jAjy2vak6lD4g0/copy and download it as .xlsx file

2.) For the Attendance Record you must download the database without the employee details. I have a existing file on MotorPH_Payroll>Attendance>Attendance.xlsx or you can just download this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kx5ym73lv7z3tLfddxjZFWOGCzpW0uF180ybw_AgHU4/edit?usp=sharing
